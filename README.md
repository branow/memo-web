Memo is a website designed for quick and efficient vocabulary memorization through the use of flashcard techniques. The distinctive features of Memo include a flashcard constructor and a dynamic study evaluation system.

The flashcard constructor enables users to effortlessly create English language vocabulary flashcards by sourcing definitions and multimedia files from the Internet. The dynamic study evaluation system guides the learning process by providing time-limited marks, where correct responses lead to an extended validity period, ranging from seconds to months and even years.
